# scan-stock-statements
This project uses the Robinhood APIs to pull holdings from their servers, build a DataFrame of relevant information, and calculate more values to add to the spreadsheet. It also generates pie charts to display diversification information, and the data is exported to a spreadsheet for any future usage.

I would also like to add features with CashApp, scanning a PDF to interpret their statement data and add to the final aggregate table.
